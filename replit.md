# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React with Vite**: Modern frontend framework with fast build tooling
- **Component System**: Utilizes Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives for consistent design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management and caching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Internationalization**: i18next for multi-language support (French, English, Spanish)
- **Theme System**: Context-based dark/light mode with localStorage persistence

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API with middleware for authentication and logging
- **Session Management**: Express-session with PostgreSQL store for admin authentication
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Simple credential-based admin authentication with 24-hour sessions
- **File Generation**: Custom utilities for VCF and CSV export functionality
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer integration for SMTP-based email broadcasts

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase for hosted database solution
- **Schema Design**: Two main tables - contacts (user registrations) and settings (system configuration)
